Since I joined this client, had the lucky to talk with a guy that is officially our PO, but also work doing some Growth Hacking and User Journey Specialist. He is one of this guys that love to analyse data from users, measure and propose changes. 

When I try to create testcases for this company, I usually talk to the Customer Support team, which knows a lot of the users struggle, but as they don't have a good habit of generate reports, we usually lost lots of good testcases to assert.

But this guy came this day with this [Hotjar][hotjar], which is able to record the mouse activity and clicks in the UI, also logging browser version, OS, location and more info from the user. With this data, we can suggest improvements in our UI and also create testcases based on the user activity. 

Worth to add some related tool in your application.
